What advice would you give to yourself if you were to start a project like this again?
Figure out p5.play at the begining and use it day one instead of wasting time making things that dont need to be made.

Did you complete everything in your "needs to have" list?
Yes, for the most part even the sword which works now with (E) despite it not being as accesable or useful as the fire ball (space).

What was the hardest part of the project?
Learning p5.play and implementing it with the boss.

Were there any problems you could not solve?
I wanted to implememt physical obstacles in the array that could colide with the player but that got too difficult and obsorbed too much time.

How was your Time Management?
It was ok, I would say that I worked on it pretty often through out the weeks since we got the project. I didnt acomplish as much as I probably should have during winter break though and the last few weeks leading to the due date were most definitely stressful. All in all the commits will be the deciding factor.
