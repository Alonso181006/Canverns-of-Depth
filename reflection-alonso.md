What advice would you give to yourself if you were to start a project like this again?
I would say either previosly figure out the Generalized Pathfinding A* algorithm, or else just immediatly start using p5.play. Secondly I would say when getting introduced to p5.play I would try play around on the website as it helps expose you to all the different built in functions that might make your life easier.

Did you complete everything in your "needs to have" list?
Yes and no, so on a technicality we did not fininsh our needs to have since we wanted player combat to be sword, but we ended having our player combat be projectiles

What was the hardest part of the project?
Although I never figured it out the hardest part of the project was pathfinding

Were there any problems you could not solve?
The problems that I couldn't solve, was first and foremost pathfinding and secondly how to make it so the player does not go through walls when travelling diagonaly
