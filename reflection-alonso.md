What advice would you give to yourself if you were to start a project like this again?
I would say either previosly figure out the Generalized Pathfinding A* algorithm, or else just immediatly start using p5.play. Secondly I would say when getting introduced to p5.play I would try play around on the website as it helps expose you to all the different built in functions that might make your life easier. 

Did you complete everything in your "needs to have" list?
Yes and no, so on a technicality we did not fininsh our needs to have since we wanted player combat to be sword, but we ended having our player combat be projectiles. Apart from that we completed all of our needs to have and one nice to have.

What was the hardest part of the project?
Although I never figured it out the hardest part of the project was pathfinding, in the previous project I had figure out A* but it turns out that it only works with consistent heuristic values, and after a good month and countless hours I had no luck. I even tried to reach out to a to my cousin's boyfriend who works at Facebook but he said he didn't have much experience with A* and it seemed to hard to figure out in a couple hours so I shifted to p5.play where I encountered many more problem. Specifically with the function groups and figuring out how it all work through a lot of trial and error.

Were there any problems you could not solve?
The problems that I couldn't solve, was first and foremost pathfinding and secondly how to stop the player from going through walls when travelling diagonaly 

How was your Time Management?
I would say my time management could have been better towards the start as in the first couple of days it started off slow and due to the A* algorithm never actually working, it ate up all my time in December, and I found myself trying to make up for lost time while trying to figure out an entire library.
